# OctoPrint-BitBang

This is an [OctoPrint](https://octoprint.org/) plugin that offers full remote access to your OctoPrint instance including live H.264 video over a single HTTPS shareable link. It uses [BitBang](https://github.com/richlegrand/bitbang) which creates a secure, fast peer-to-peer connection that requires no account, no subscription, port forwarding, tunnel, or VPN.

This is part of the [BitBang project](https://github.com/richlegrand/bitbang). 

## What you get

- **Full remote access:** You get full access from anywhere through a secure HTTPS URL. Configure, upload G-code, start jobs, see live video, etc. 
- **One link, no account set-up:** Remote access, share the URL, share your printer.
- **Live H.264 video:** Frames come straight from the camera, hardware-encoded on Pi 4 (`/dev/video11` V4L2 M2M) and software-encoded on Pi 5 or any other Linux host, then packetized by aiortc and delivered as a WebRTC media stream. CPU footprint is around 40% (single core) on Pi4. 
- **BitBang URL access is optional:** Video streaming works with local access through local network URL also.
- **Pi CSI camera or USB webcam:** Auto-detected (IMX477, IMX219, IMX708, or any V4L2-capable USB webcam). 
- **Camera controls:** Camera selection, live brightness slider, fullscreen button, image flip H/V buttons, and resolution selection (VGA up to 720p).
- **Snapshots and timelapse:** Integrates with OctoPrint's `WebcamProviderPlugin` API -- snapshots are grabbed from the live stream, so no second camera pipeline to configure.
- **Mobile friendly:** BitBang URL works with phones/tablets.
- **PIN protection:** Optional PIN required to access the remote URL.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

These steps are outside the plugin -- do them first.

**Free the camera** from whatever streamer your image ships. On OctoPi:

```bash
sudo systemctl disable --now webcamd ffmpeg_hls camera-streamer
```

DietPi runs `mjpg-streamer` instead:

```bash
sudo systemctl disable --now mjpg-streamer
```

**Non-OctoPi Linux** (DietPi, plain Debian, Ubuntu) usually has no `v4l-utils` package, which OctoPi preinstalls. BitBang shells out to `v4l2-ctl` to enumerate cameras and their resolutions, so without it the camera dropdown in **Settings → BitBang** comes up empty and the hardware H.264 paths are skipped:

```bash
sudo apt install -y v4l-utils
```

Check `ffmpeg` is present too (`ffmpeg -version`); OctoPi ships it for timelapse rendering, other images may not. Without it BitBang falls back to software encoding.

**32-bit Raspberry Pi OS** (`armv7l`, the standard OctoPi image) also needs `aiortc` and `pylibsrtp` rebuilt once, because its [piwheels](https://www.piwheels.org/) wheels link newer system libraries than Bookworm ships:

```bash
sudo apt install -y libvpx-dev libopus-dev libsrtp2-dev
~/oprint/bin/pip install --no-binary aiortc,pylibsrtp --force-reinstall --no-deps aiortc==1.10.1 pylibsrtp==1.0.0
```

64-bit and x86_64 need nothing further.

### Install the plugin

In OctoPrint, open **Settings → Plugin Manager → Get More**, search for **BitBang**, and click **Install**.

If it doesn't show up yet — Plugin Manager caches its plugin list for up to a day — you can install it right away by choosing **... from URL** instead and pasting:

```
https://github.com/richlegrand/OctoPrint-BitBang/releases/latest/download/release.zip
```

Prefer the command line? `~/oprint/bin/pip install OctoPrint-BitBang` installs the same package. Whichever route you take, don't install from the GitHub *source* zip — it omits the bundled proxy binaries, so remote access and video won't work.

### Set up the camera

1. Restart OctoPrint to load the plugin — `sudo systemctl restart octoprint` (Plugin Manager offers to do this for you).

2. Point your browser to your OctoPrint server, open the Control tab, and choose **BitBang Camera** from the webcam selector at the top-right.

3. Open **Settings → BitBang** and choose camera from dropdown.

4. Choose resolution.

5. Save and **restart OctoPrint**.

6. Refresh the OctoPrint tab in your browser. A button labeled BitBang is available in the menu bar -- click it for the URL.

![Camera dropdown](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/richlegrand/OctoPrint-BitBang/refs/heads/main/assets/bitbang_select.png)

![BitBang URL](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/richlegrand/OctoPrint-BitBang/refs/heads/main/assets/bitbang_url.png)

This URL allows remote access to your printer.

7. Set `Snapshot Webcam` in **Settings → Webcam and Timelapse** to `BitBang Camera` if you want timelapse video/images of your prints.

## Configuration

All settings live in **Settings → BitBang**:

| Setting | Effect |
|---|---|
| Enabled | Toggle BitBang remote access |
| PIN | **Required by default.** At least 4 characters; prompted on the remote URL. Remote access stays **off** until a PIN is set (or "Allow no PIN" is ticked). |
| Allow no PIN | Expose remote access with no PIN (not recommended — anyone with the link can control the printer) |
| Camera | Auto-detect, or select from dropdown list |
| Resolution | VGA → HD (depending on what selected camera supports) |
| Flip horizontal / vertical | Flip video if necessary |

Changes to the PIN and Enabled settings take effect immediately (no OctoPrint restart). Full-screen button and brightness slider are overlaid on the video window (Control tab) and update immediately.

### Set a PIN (required)

BitBang exposes a public link to your printer, so it is protected by a PIN. On
first install a **setup wizard** prompts you to choose one — remote access does
not start until you do (fail-closed). You can change it any time under
**Settings → BitBang**.

## How it works

- The `bitbang-python` package handles WebRTC signaling, identity, and the ASGI interface.
- This plugin wraps it with OctoPrint integration: settings UI, `WebcamProviderPlugin` hooks, camera auto-detect, CSRF-safe cookie handling, and a webcam-provider template that renders the H.264 `<video>` in OctoPrint's Control tab.
- The bitba.ng cloud acts purely as a signaling relay to broker a direct connection. If a direct connection isn't available, bitba.ng will use TURN instead.

## Privacy

The BitBang plugin connects through the `bitba.ng` cloud signaling service to broker peer-to-peer connections. Here is what `bitba.ng` does and does not see:

- **Signaling:** When the plugin starts, it registers with `bitba.ng` using a public key derived from a locally-generated keypair (the private key never leaves your device). `bitba.ng` sees this public key, the derived UID that becomes part of your URL, and connection metadata (timestamps, IPs of peers attempting to connect).
- **Media path:** Once a peer connects, video and HTTP traffic flow **directly** between the browser and your OctoPrint host over an encrypted WebRTC data channel (DTLS-SRTP). `bitba.ng` does not see this traffic.
- **TURN fallback:** If a direct connection cannot be established (strict NAT/firewall), `bitba.ng` may relay the *encrypted* WebRTC stream via TURN. Even in that case, the relay sees ciphertext only — it cannot decrypt your video, OctoPrint UI, or credentials.
- **No account, no tracking:** The plugin does not create an account, send telemetry, or upload usage data.
- **Access control:** Anyone with your URL can reach your OctoPrint instance. Set a **PIN** in the plugin settings to require a passcode on the remote URL.

See the [BitBang project page](https://github.com/richlegrand/bitbang) for the full signaling protocol and identity specifications.

## Supported hardware

- **Raspberry Pi 4 (32- or 64-bit OS)** -- hardware H.264 via the V4L2 M2M encoder (`h264_v4l2m2m`); tested with IMX477, IMX219
- **Raspberry Pi 5** -- no hardware H.264 encoder; software H.264 (picamera2's `LibavH264Encoder` for CSI, aiortc for V4L2), which the A76 CPU handles at 720p@30
- **Linux PC / laptop / SBC with Intel or AMD GPU** -- hardware H.264 re-encoding via VAAPI (`h264_vaapi` via `/dev/dri/renderD*`); tested with USB webcams
- **CSI cameras** -- via picamera2/libcamera where available, or the legacy mmal device (`/dev/video2`) as a direct H.264 passthrough
- **USB webcams** -- cams with onboard H.264 stream as a zero-encode passthrough; otherwise hardware-re-encoded on Pi 4 (`h264_v4l2m2m`) or via VAAPI (`h264_vaapi`), or software-encoded elsewhere
- **Generic Linux PC/laptop/SBC without hardware acceleration** -- software H.264 via aiortc

> **`ffmpeg` is required for the hardware H.264 paths.** The Pi CSI (legacy/mmal) passthrough, the USB hardware re-encode on Pi 4 (`h264_v4l2m2m`), and VAAPI hardware acceleration (`h264_vaapi`) drive the system `ffmpeg` binary. If `ffmpeg` or hardware encoding is missing, BitBang automatically falls back to software encoding.

## Installation Notes

Skip this if [Installation](#installation) worked.

The video stack is `av` ([PyAV](https://github.com/PyAV-Org/PyAV)) + `aiortc`, pulled in as wheels, and needs **Python 3.10+** — OctoPi 1.0.x (Bullseye / Python 3.9) has no usable `av` wheel, so upgrade the image to 1.1.0+. On **64-bit** (`aarch64` / `x86_64`) the PyPI wheels bundle their native libraries and work as-is; **32-bit** (`armv7l`) needs the extra step in [Installation](#installation) above, because its [piwheels](https://www.piwheels.org/) wheels link newer system libraries than Bookworm ships.

### Pi CSI camera not detected (falls back to USB)

The Pi CSI camera is driven through [`picamera2`](https://github.com/raspberrypi/picamera2), a **system** package installed via `apt` -- it is not on PyPI. Your OctoPrint venv can only import it if the venv was created with access to system site-packages. If it can't, CSI auto-detect fails and the plugin **silently falls back to a USB webcam** (or no camera) -- the plugin still loads, so the only symptom is the wrong camera.

Check from inside your OctoPrint venv:

```bash
python -c "import picamera2"   # ImportError -> the venv cannot see picamera2
```

If that errors, recreate the venv with system site-packages and reinstall OctoPrint and the plugin into it:

```bash
python3 -m venv --system-site-packages /path/to/oprint
```

USB webcams work in a plain venv -- this only affects the Pi CSI camera.

### Diagnostic mode

If the video stack fails to import for any reason, the plugin still loads -- settings and navbar are visible, and `octoprint.log` shows a clear `BitBang video stack unavailable: <reason>` line. You can see the missing piece in OctoPrint instead of grepping logs.
